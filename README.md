# Sensoponics
Automated Smart monitoring and Irrigation System using Arduino Uno

Sesoponics is short for Sensors(Senso) and Work(Ponos) that makes it sensoponics an IoT Project that monitors all the Statistics Possible 
somewhat like # Google Tulip but on an exploration stage.

The Project Uses the following Tools.
1. Arduino Uno
2. Bunch of Sensors & Actuator compatible with Arduino
3. ThingSpeak IoT App and API to store and retrive data over internet
4. Some 5V Power Supply
5. A Plant for Testing (MUST ðŸ˜œ)

One Quick Demo of Project is Availble here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lNMmSsD_Dz0RVbFGQVljZmzjmf62wOM6/view?usp=sharing

Setup is not much difficult if you know what goes where ðŸ˜ƒ.
To Recreate the project Read the [Project_Setup](Project_Setup.ino) file. 

**Project History:**
I started this project in Jan, 2018 for my Minor Project in Engineering. It takes me about 6 months 
to acheive the basic functionality then another anothe 10 months to update and make the project more efficient. I have also published a paper on the same you can access it from [springer.com](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811371653) .
